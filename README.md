## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
Twitter is a great way to keep up to date on the latest developments you‚Äôre interested in, however I may not have time to check what‚Äôs been happening every day. This project produces a HTML email of tweets from your followers ordered by popularity.

Note this project excludes tweets that don‚Äôt contain a weblink, this is to avoid including tweets that don‚Äôt link to a piece of content. In example tweets commenting about a sports event or conference are less interesting after the event. 

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
The project is built using R version 3.6.0 and utilises the rtweet library for accessing Twitter on your behalf, this is done via by generating a token.

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

- [Required R packages](#r_packages)
